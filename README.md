# Real-Time Fight Detection using SlowFast R50

## About the Project

This project is a real-time fight detection system built using the SlowFast R50 action recognition model.

The idea behind this project was to explore how deep learning can be used to automatically detect violent activities in surveillance footage. Instead of analyzing individual images, the model learns motion patterns across multiple video frames, allowing it to understand actions over time.

The system processes video streams, predicts whether a fight is occurring, and displays the result in real time.

---

## How It Works

The model receives a sequence of video frames and classifies the activity into one of two categories:

* Fight
* Normal

A sliding window of 32 frames is maintained during inference. These frames are processed through the SlowFast architecture, which captures both detailed motion information and long-term temporal patterns.

To make predictions more stable, a small temporal smoothing buffer is applied before displaying the final result.
